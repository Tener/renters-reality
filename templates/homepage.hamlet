    <div .tab-pane #about>
      <p>
        We aim to provide an easy to use service where residents can 
        write a review of their landlord.

      <p>
        Would-be residents can then search our database before 
        unknowingly renting an apartment from a bad landlord.

      <p>
        If you find any bugs or would like to request a feature please 
        use the

    <h3>Search tips

  <div .modal-body>
    <p>
      By default, the search will return matches on landlord name and 
      reviewed address.

    <p>
      That means that if you search for "brighton" you'll get results 
      for both "Brighton, MA" 
      <strong>and 
      "Brighton Realty"

    <p>
      Since this isn't always wanted, there are two prefixes you can use 
      to change how the search is performed:

    <dl>
      <dd>
        <code>landlord: something
      <dt>
        <em>
          Only show reviews where "something" is part of the landlord's 
          name
      <dd>
        <code>address: something else
      <dt>
        <em>
          Only show reviews where "something else" is part of the address

  <div .modal-footer>
    <p>
      Results are sorted by closest match, then most recent.
