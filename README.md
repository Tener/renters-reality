# Renters' Reality

### The concept

Think Angie's list specifically for Landlords.

### The status

The site works, un-related people have actually posted reviews. It gets 
very little traffic and it's not very featureful.

To motivate myself to keep it maintained and running, I use it to 
explore new technologies and ways to really stretch the web framework I 
contribute to (yesod).

Currently, I'm refactoring it to strip as much unneeded code as possible 
and keep things as simple as the task requires.

For instance, I've offloaded a ton of CSS and JavaScript onto Bootstrap, 
twitter's awesome CSS/JS framework.

Here's a sneak peak of how sweet that makes things look:

Hopefully that'll go live soon.
