# TODO

In no particular order...

* make it pretty!

* wildcard search

  *almost impossible without framework enhancements*

* display recent reviews on homepage

  *like a twitter feed?*

* change verbiage around Search

  *Make it clear autocomplete will show available choices and anything else will yield "no results"*

* edit/delete "my" reviews

* rss feeds

    1. recent reviews
    2. reviews by landlord

* notifications 

    1. my landlord is reviewed
    2. comments on my reviews
